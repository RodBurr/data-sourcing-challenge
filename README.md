# data-sourcing-challenge
Purpose is to extract data from the NASA API, specifically its GST data and its CME data.
Next, merge the data together and compute the average time it takes for a CME to cause a GST. 
The over all goal is to later have this data used with Machine Learning models to create predictions.
